        <h1>Welcome to Johnny Ving's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            Greetings! I'm Johnny Ving, currently a third-year student at the University of Southern California, pursuing a major in Computer Science with a focus on Game Design. My academic journey began at Evergreen Valley College, where I laid the foundation in computer science. This path led me to USC, where I'm now diving deep into the intricate world of game design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academia, I'm actively involved in the gaming industry as a content creator at Fire Games, working under the renowned creator Preston. Here, I'm harnessing my creativity and technical skills to contribute to engaging and innovative game content. This role complements my academic pursuits, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting, thus enriching my understanding of the gaming landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            This portfolio is a window into my world – a blend of academic achievements, professional experiences, and a deep-seated passion for game development. Join me in exploring this dynamic and exciting journey.
        </p>

        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>
            My academic path reflects a strong foundation in computer science, augmented by practical experiences in game development. I've been immersed in a diverse range of activities, 
            from leadership roles in the Computer Science Club to active participation in Key Club and Tails Club during my high school years. These experiences have honed my skills in 
            collaboration, leadership, and community engagement. I have learned throughout my journey that the best way to learn is to teach. I have been a tutor for over 3 years, and these have brought out life lessons in me that I otherwise would have never put any emphasis on. I have learned so much from myself and others through this process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I've made significant strides in the gaming industry. From the age of 13, I have been experiementing in game development and game design on platforms like Roblox, 
            and using engines like Blender, Roblox Studio, and Unreal. I am currently at Fire Games, which is a studio led by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70Dib4MvFfT1tU6MqeyHpQ">Preston</a>
            , I am the lead in development of innovative game titles like <a href="https://twitter.com/TubbyWorld">Tubby’s World</a> and "100 Laws Escape", which are a current work in progress. 
            My role as an Accelerator Intern Team Lead at Roblox allowed me to guide and launch original titles, sharpening my skills in project management and creative development. 
            These experiences, combined with independent projects on platforms like Roblox, have shaped me into a versatile developer, skilled in C++, Java, Lua, and more.

                <p>A silly project we worked on with the Fire Games team over the timespan of a week. In response to a "Skibidi" challenge by Little Big, we created a game that was inspired by the music video.

                <p>This game was developed in 2016, when I was only 13-14 years old.
                    Songify is a competitive Guess The Song game, where you go up against other players to see who really knows their music! 
                    It consists of several different types of matches, such as team deathmatches, or even juggernaut rounds.
                    This game performed very well at the time, but it died down as I left the platform for a while to pursue other interests.

                <p>This game went through 6 months of development. It was released and was a huge hit! 

                    Happy, the universe's first autonomous store-cleaning robot, seems to be programmed to do more than just eliminate waste...
                    Can you be the first to escape Wobmart after dark? Or will you be the next victim of Happy's wrath?

                    In this game you must find scanners & pick up items needed to unlock them, push other players to mess them up and take their items, and complete all 3 scanners to unlock trapdoors and escape.
