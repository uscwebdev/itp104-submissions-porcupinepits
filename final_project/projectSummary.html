This final project is a portfolio for myself, Johnny Ving.

It goes over my qualifications and my past projects so that I can (with ease) show it to potential employers or mutuals who wish to see my work in a centralized location.

The extras that were used are: iframes to embed my resume into the page, and a HTML5 Media Tags to embed a video of a Tubby's World trailer into the page.
