        <h1>Welcome to Johnny Ving's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            Greetings! I'm Johnny Ving, currently a third-year student at the University of Southern California, pursuing a major in Computer Science with a focus on Game Design. My academic journey began at Evergreen Valley College, where I laid the foundation in computer science. This path led me to USC, where I'm now diving deep into the intricate world of game design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academia, I'm actively involved in the gaming industry as a content creator at Fire Games, working under the renowned creator Preston. Here, I'm harnessing my creativity and technical skills to contribute to engaging and innovative game content. This role complements my academic pursuits, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting, thus enriching my understanding of the gaming landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            This portfolio is a window into my world – a blend of academic achievements, professional experiences, and a deep-seated passion for game development. Join me in exploring this dynamic and exciting journey.

        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>
            My academic path reflects a strong foundation in computer science, augmented by practical experiences in game development. I've been immersed in a diverse range of activities, from leadership roles in the Computer Science Club to active participation in Key Club and Tails Club during my high school years. These experiences have honed my skills in collaboration, leadership, and community engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I've made significant strides in the gaming industry. At Fire Games/TBNR Productions, I led the development of innovative game titles like "Tubby’s World" and "100 Laws Escape". My role as an Accelerator Intern Team Lead at Roblox allowed me to guide and launch original titles, sharpening my skills in project management and creative development. These experiences, combined with independent projects on platforms like Roblox, have shaped me into a versatile developer, skilled in C++, Java, Lua, and more.
